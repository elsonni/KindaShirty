    <p>Welcome to TheKindaBrands, LLC ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website (the "Site") and our print-on-demand merchandise services (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Site, creating an account, uploading content, or purchasing products, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. User Accounts and Eligibility</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>You own or have the necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to use and commercialize all aspects of your User Content.</li>
      <li>Your User Content does not infringe on any third-party rights including copyrights, trademarks, or publicity/privacy rights.</li>
      <li>Your content does not contain offensive, unlawful, or harmful material.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not pre-screen content. You are solely responsible for your content and any legal consequences arising from it.</p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of your User Content. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, distribute, and display your content for purposes of operating the Service.</p>
    <p>You agree not to upload content that infringes or violates any rights of others, including intellectual property and publicity rights. This includes unauthorized use of celebrity names, images, characters, logos, or likenesses.</p>

    <h2>4. Parody and Fan Content</h2>
    <p>We allow parody, satire, and fan-inspired content to the extent permissible under applicable laws, including U.S. fair use doctrine. Not all such content is exempt from infringement. You are responsible for ensuring your content qualifies as lawful parody or transformative use.</p>

    <h2>5. No Affiliation with IP Holders</h2>
    <p>Unless explicitly stated, we are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any brand, celebrity, or intellectual property owner. References to third-party IP are for identification and commentary and do not imply endorsement.</p>

    <h2>6. DMCA Policy and Notice of Infringement</h2>
    <p>Each artist/seller account holder must confirm that each design they upload is done so only in that they are the owner of any/all designs they upload, or that they are working in conjunction with the owner with appropriate rights to the IP through partnership or promotion. Unfortunately there may be users who do not adhere to the appropriate use of IP. In the age of the internet it is impossible for any one person or organization to know every design that enjoys protection under IP law. Therefore, we comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").</p>
