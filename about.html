        <p>
          At <strong>KindaShirty</strong>, we’re not afraid to be a little bold, a little weird, and a whole lot of fun.
          What started as a side hustle making clever t-shirts for friends has grown into a full-blown mission to bring smiles, smirks, and side-eyes to wardrobes everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're celebrating the absurd, the nostalgic, or just love a good pun, we've got a shirt for that.
          All of our designs are printed in-house with attention to detail, quality, and sarcasm. Probably too much sarcasm.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Why Shop With Us?</h2>

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #888;">P.S. Yes, we’re totally judging you based on your shirt. Make it a good one.</p>
